; ===INSTRUCTIONS===
; Place each flavor text in its own line under the appropriate section.
; Cards that fall into more than one category will use all of the appropriate category. So a Synchro Pendulum Monster can get a flavor text from the generic, monster, syncro, or pendulum sections.
; [X] will be replaced with the name of the card it is on.
; [Y] will be replaced with the name of a random Monster card.
; Lines starting with ; are comments and will be ignored.
; If you need a flavor text to span multiple lines, \n functions as a linebreak.

===GENERIC===
I'd put some ancient Egyptian text here if I could.
The problem with using Duel Disks is that you can't read your opponent's cards from 30 feet away.
Let's be honest. You wouldn't read this card even if you could.
You don't know what this card does. But since your opponent bothered to play it, it must be good, right?
Don't worry about this card. It doesn't do anything important. I promise.
This card's effect was too hot for the TCG.
We've moved beyond censoring card arts and have started censoring effects.
Before you take your opponent's card, remember what happened to Mai when she stole Ra.
This is card brought to you by the Heart of the Cards.
Surely this card will get a retrain someday.
Be careful. This card might have a secret effect.
Statistically speaking, there is someone who lost to this card once and has been calling for its ban ever since.
I'm sorry, but the the Great Leviathan said it doesn't want your soul after all.
You could try using the Millennium Eye to read your opponent's mind to find out what this card does, but I really don't recomment it. Just trust me on this.
This card is great in Forbidden Memories.
Konami, please implement this format in Master Duel.
Have you ever even seen this card before?
This is Yu-Gi-Oh the way Kazuki Takahashi intended.
This card can FTK when used with [Y].
...except "Frog the Jam".
#FreePity
Is this the fabled "The Out" you've heard so much about?
Which part of the Duel Terminal storyline was this?
This card was better under Duelist Kingdom rules.
I apologize to all the fans of Nekroz, Megalith, Assault Mode, and all the other cards that just don't work because of how this format works.
I could be testing for more bugs. Instead, I wrote flavor text.
This card would be good in limited.
This card has a real card's effect, so it can't be broken. Right?
Pegasus handcrafted every single one of these cards.
This card was designed by Chumley.
I think I saw this in a Gradius game once.
Fun Fact: The OCG version of this card includes a war crime.
Yusei found this card in a dumpster.
Sometimes, reading the card does not explain the card.
Yugi never stopped to read an opponent's card.

===MONSTER===
Haste\nVigilance\nTrample\n[X] must be blocked if able.\n[X] or another creature you control must block every attacking creature if able.
[X]'s offensive capabilities have greatly increased, but the strangeness of its behavior has magnified in equal measure. This worries me.\n-Professor Kozaky
If a child it has made friends with is bullied, [X] will find the bully's house and burn it to the ground.
[X] is said to emerge from darkness to steal the lives of those who become lost in mountains.
It is whispered that any child who mistakes [X] for a balloon and holds on to it could wind up missing.
Keep an eye out for my [X]/[Y] fanfic coming soon!
[X] has chosen itself to become your Deck Master.
[X]'s battle prowess is easily matched and can be safely ignored.
[X] wears the skull of its deceased mother. Its cries echo inside the skull and come out as a sad melody.
Gagagigo will probably fight this at some point.
Would. Next question.
Someone at my locals uses a playmat featuring [X] in a maid outfit. Should I be concerned?
If you destroy [X], its Duel Spirit will haunt you.
[X]'s application to join the Rescue Squad was rejected for not being cute enough.
I hear [X] will be the star of the next OCG Stories manga.
[X] is having an existential crisis and doesn't want to become material.
[X] is the embodiment of Visas Starfrost's ennui.
You're the one who wants to destroy [X], so who's the real monster?
[X] might actually be an Ojama in disguise.
Did you know that in terms of Duel Spirit breeding, [X] is the most compatible...
The [X] Duel Spirit probably seemed pretty out of place in ancient Egypt.
I would make a Capsule Monsters joke here, but I've never seen it, and you probably haven't either.
